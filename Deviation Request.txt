Deviation Requests:
Exceptions from the Coding Rules TCN-TRDP1-A-BOM-008-04

1. Rule	20106	(M)	File names shall be unique within the project.
- Because of the multi-target nature and the implementation of the Virtual Operating System (vos), filenames for the same
  functionality in different targets are kept equal.
  Each file without unique filename has a check for the corresponding target define (POSIX, WIN32 etc.)

2. Rule	20601	(M)	Use standard type names for commonly used types
- In the target-dependent VOS implementation files, the standard types of that target will be used to fit the OS API.

3. Rule	30103	(M)	Every function definition shall be documented with an introductory comment.
- The format should be compatible with the Doxygen commenting rules.

4. Rule	40006	(M)	Accesses to fix addresses in memory (for example registers) and members in communication telegrams
                    shall be done by address constants.
- PD and MD Header definitions are defined as packed structs respecting target compilers (GCC and MS-VC).
  Definitions nevertheless follow natural alignement (UINT32 on 4 Bytes, UINT16 on 2 Byte boundaries, no padding involved).
